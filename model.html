<h4>GeoRSS ::<br/>Geographically Encoded Objects for RSS feeds</h4>
<h2>GeoRSS Model</h2>

<a name="model"></a>
<p><img src="graphics/georss-model.png" width="587" height="346" />
<strong>
<p align="center">Figure 1. - GeoRSS Model</p>
</strong>

<p>Figure 1 shows the UML model for GeoRSS. The left side of Figure 1 represents
  GeoRSS, the right side represents the &quot;external&quot; content that GeoRSS is being
used to describe. In the model, <strong>where</strong> is an association <em>of</em> a <strong>geometry</strong> to
some
  <strong>content</strong>. GeoRSS places no constraint on the type of content,
  nor on its format.
<p>GeoRSS itself is identified by a namespace, indicated by &quot;georss:&quot;.
  The model above does not show, but allows, the inclusion of any other elements
  from other
  namespaces.
<p>The model itself is an abstract concept. In order to use the model, it must
  be expressed in a concrete form such as XML, RDF, etc. These expressions are
  called <strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serialization">serializations</a></strong>.
<p>By allowing for the definition of multiple serializations, all of which conform
  to the model, GeoRSS will provide the means of relating one serialization to
  another. The goal is to also map the model to existing serializations where
  possible.
<p>The core concepts of GeoRSS are explained below. These concepts
    are then encoded or serialized in
    XML for use with <a href="#atomenc">Atom or RSS 2.0</a>. Alternate serializations
    such as in RDF and XHTML are
    also being developed.
<h3>Coordinate reference system (CRS)</h3>
<p>There aren't real grid lines or axes on the earth, so any GeoRSS coordinates
  must refer to a <a href="https://portal.opengeospatial.org/files/?artifact_id=6716">coordinate
  reference system</a> which has been defined and agreed to by geodesists and
  software makers alike. The GeoRSS  CRS is the global (and GPS-preferred) <strong>WGS84,
  latitude, longitude</strong> (in that order), using <strong>decimal degrees</strong>.
   Note that GeoRSS
  lines and boundaries are allowed to do things like cross the dateline or circle
  the poles.</p>
<h3>Geometry</h3>
<p>The geometric shapes which can be used to represent location in GeoRSS
  are <strong>point</strong>, <strong>line</strong>,
  and <strong>boundary</strong>. </p>
<p>A <strong>point</strong> contains a single coordinate pair. The coordinate pair contains a
  latitude value and a longitude value<em> in that order</em>. The <em>preferred</em> serialization
  of this uses a <em>space</em> to separate the two values.</p>
<p>A <strong>line</strong> contains two or more coordinate pairs. Each pair contains
  a latitude value and a longitude value<em> in that order</em>. The <em>preferred</em> serialization
of this uses a <em>space</em> to separate the two values.  Pairs are  separated
from each other
by a <em>space</em>.</p>
<p>A <strong>box</strong> contains exactly two coordinate pairs. Each
  pair contains a latitude value and a longitude value<em> in that order</em>.
  The <em>preferred</em> serialization of this uses a <em>space</em> to separate
  the two values. Pairs are separated from each other
by a <em>space</em>. The first coordinate pair (lower corner) must be a point
further
west and south of the second coordinate pair (upper corner) and the box is always
interpreted
as
not
containing the 180 (or -180) degree longitude line other than on its boundary
and
not
containing
the
North
or South pole other than on its boundary. A box <em>is generally</em> used to <em>roughly</em>demarcate
an area within which other data lie.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="graphics/gml_envelope.jpg" width="260" height="140" /></p>
<p>A <strong>polygon</strong> contains at least four coordinate pairs. Each
  pair contains a latitude value and a longitude value<em> in that order</em>.
  The <em>preferred</em> serialization
    of this uses a <em>space</em> to separate the two values. Pairs are separated
    from each other
  by a <em>space</em>. The last coordinate pair must be identical to the first.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="graphics/179-rule.jpg" width="446" height="248" /></p>
<p align="center"><strong>Figure 2. - 179 degree rule</strong></p>
<p>Due to the fact that the Earth is round, we have to place some constraints
  on the geometries to avoid ambiguous shapes. In order to be able to easily
   represent the red box in Figure 2, where the left side of the box is at 160
  degrees longitude and the right side of the box is at -175 degrees,<strong> no
  two points in a line or polygon may have latitude values that are more than
  179
  degrees
  apart</strong>. This constraint avoids other approaches that require either
  additional information about the topology of the geometry or preclude the ability
  to represen
  geometries such as this. Since topology is beyond
  the scope of this specification, it should not matter that you may have to
  add
  an extra point into your geometries. <strong>Line</strong> and <strong>polygon</strong> <strong>MUST</strong>  follow
  this rule. <strong>Box</strong> does not.</p>
<h3>Feature Type Tag</h3>
<p>GeoRSS geometry is meant to represent a real feature of the Earth's surface.
  The GeoRSS model allows for a single <em>string</em> containing a <strong>featuretypetag</strong>.
  No constraints are placed on this string. The intent is to allow a Feature
  Type <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folksonomy">folksonomy</a>  to
  emerge. The default is &quot;<strong>location&quot;</strong>.  </p>
<h3>Relationship Tag</h3>
<p>GeoRSS is a way of <em>relating</em> Web <strong>content</strong> to Earth <strong>features</strong>.
  The GeoRSS model allows for a single string containing a <strong>relationshiptag</strong>.
  No constraints are placed on this string. The intent is to allow a relationship <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folksonomy">folksonomy</a> to
  emerge.The default
  relationship, &quot;<strong>is-located-at</strong>&quot; simply indicates that
  the subject of the content<strong>  </strong>is located
  at<strong> </strong> the
  GeoRSS feature. </p>
<h3>Elevation</h3>
<p>In order to provide a means of expressing an elevation, the Simple form of
  GeoRSS has two special tags. These tags are not meant to be used in the
  GML version since elevation values would be properly expressed based in more
  precise
  terms. The tags are <strong>elev</strong> and <strong>floor</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>elev</strong> is meant to contain &quot;common&quot; GPS elevation readings,
  i.e. height in meters from the WGS84 ellipsoid, which is a reading that should
  be easy to get from any GPS device.</p>
<p><strong>floor</strong> is meant to contain the floor number of a building. In some countries
  the numbering is different than in other countries, but since we'll know the
  location of the building, it should be fairly unambiguous.</p>

<!--<h2>Examples</h2>
<p>Default Example: &ldquo;I go to the UPS Store {42.280297,-71.235639} a few times a week to pick up my mail.&rdquo; This means &ldquo;The subject of the text snippet (UPS Store) is located at a location represented by a position in WGS84 coordinates.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Non-default Example: &ldquo;I go to the UPS Store {point, UTM Zone 19 4683318.0N 315659.72E, mailbox, is located at} a few times a week to pick up my mail.&rdquo; This means &ldquo;The subject of the text snippet (UPS Store) is located at a location represented by a point in WGS84 coordinates.&rdquo; </p>
<h2>Constraints<a name="constraints"></a></h2>
<p>When used in RSS, the &lt;Item&gt; tag can only contain one geo object. If your document has more than one geo object, then you should decide what the &lt;Item&gt; geo should be. Bounding box, center, etc.</p>
