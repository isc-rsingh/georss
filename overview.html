{% include header.html title="GeoRSS overview" %}

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS_%28file_format%29 " target="_blank">RSS</a> is
  a family of XML formats for exchanging news, especially news about Web pages
  or other Web content. Many dynamic web sites, especially <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog">Weblogs</a> or "Blogs" now
  provide RSS "feeds" of their new or changed content. Another common term for
  a source of news in RSS format is"<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_feed" target="_blank">Web
  feed</a>". The basic idea is a simple, brief, and structured XML format which
  includes only key descriptive elements like author, date, title, narrative
  description, and hypertext link, elements which help a reader (or an RSS "aggregator" service)
  decide what source materials are worth examining in more detail. This concise,
  structured format has also proven useful for publishing all kinds of small,
  time-sensitive nuggets of information, including <a href="http://www.flickr.com/" target="_blank">Flickr's</a> photo
  journals, <a href="http://www.craigslist.org/" target="_blank">Craigslist classifieds</a>,
  and <a href="http://crcp-blogger.mit.edu/geoblogger/" target="_blank">local
  events.</a> </p>
<p><a href="http://www.georss.org" target="_blank">GeoRSS</a> is simple proposal
  for RSS feeds to also be
described by location or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geotagging" target="_blank">Geotagged</a>.
We standardize the way in which "where" is encoded
with enough <em>simplicity</em> and <em>descriptive power</em> to
satisfy most needs to describe the location of Web content. 
GeoRSS may not work for every use (for example, we provide for only one location
per RSS entry), but it should serve as an easy-to-use geotagging language that
is brief and simple with useful defaults but extensible and
upwardly-compatible with more sophisticated formats like the <a href="http://www.opengeospatial.org/">OGC
(Open Geospatial Consortium)</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geography_Markup_Language">GML</a> (Geography
Markup Language).</p>
<p>GeoRSS also serves informally as an extension to the W3C <a href="http://www.w3.org/2003/01/geo/" target="_blank">geo
    (point)</a> vocabulary
(sometimes also referred to as "GeoRSS"), adding important additional kinds of
location
(points, lines, and boundaries) as well as other extensibility.</p>
<p>As an example of the need for more than just a point, consider a blog about a kayaking trip. Each RSS entry from such a blog could perhaps be described
by a point location, but the entire voyage is clearly a linear path. The line description is
especially important for making maps of trips with trip lengths, intersections, and so on.
Boundaries are important when you need to specify the edges of an area, which is very
useful in talking about things within a certain state, town, or
neighborhood for example.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most powerful advantages of GeoRSS feeds will be seen
in the possibilities for geographic search and aggregation. More than just
  getting feeds for a particular city or zip code, using GeoRSS it will be posssible
  to search with all sorts of geographic criteria. Perhaps all earthquake-related
  items within 20 miles of your home--delivered to your phone, or a feed of traffic
  accident items along your daily commute? Once RSS feeds contain geographic
location, applications like these and more will be possible. </p>
