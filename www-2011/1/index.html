<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This site describes a number of ways to encode location in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS_%28file_format%29" target="_blank">RSS</a> feeds. As RSS becomes more and more prevalent as a way to publish and share information, it becomes increasingly important that location is described in an interoperable manner so that applications can <strong>request</strong>, <strong>aggregate</strong>, <strong>share</strong> and <strong>map</strong> geographically tagged feeds.</p>
<p> To avoid the fragmentation of language that has occured in RSS and other Web information encoding efforts, we have created this site to promote a relatively small number of encodings that meet the needs of a wide range of communities. By building these encodings on a common information model, we hope to promote interoperability and &quot;upwards-compatibility&quot; across encodings. </p>
<p>At this point we have completed work on two encodings which we are calling GeoRSS GML and GeoRSS Simple. GeoRSS GML is a formal <a href="http://www.opengeospatial.org/groups/?iid=31" target="_blank">GML</a> Application Profile, and supports a greater range of features than Simple, notably coordinate reference systems other than WGS84 latitude/longitude. It is designed for use with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom_%28standard%29" target="_blank">Atom 1.0</a>, RSS 2.0 and RSS 1.0, although it can be used just as easily in non-RSS XML encodings.  GeoRSS Simple has greater brevity, but also has limited extensibility. It can be used in all the same ways and places as GeoRSS GML. </p>
<p>Finally, if you've come here simply looking for a way to encode a point in XML, use either the 'GML' or 'Simple' version:</p>
Simple<br/>
<pre><strong>&lt;georss:point&gt;45.256 -71.92&lt;/georss:point&gt;</strong></pre>

GML<br/>
<pre><strong>&lt;georss:where&gt;
   &lt;gml:Point&gt;
      &lt;gml:pos&gt;45.256 -71.92&lt;/gml:pos&gt;
   &lt;/gml:Point&gt;</strong><strong>
&lt;/georss:where&gt;</strong></pre>

<h2>GeoRSS overview</h2>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS_%28file_format%29 " target="_blank">RSS</a> is
  a family of XML formats for exchanging news, especially news about Web pages
  or other Web content. Many dynamic web sites, especially <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog">Weblogs</a> or "Blogs" now
  provide RSS "feeds" of their new or changed content. Another common term for
  a source of news in RSS format is"<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_feed" target="_blank">Web
  feed</a>". The basic idea is a simple, brief, and structured XML format which
  includes only key descriptive elements like author, date, title, narrative
  description, and hypertext link, elements which help a reader (or an RSS "aggregator" service)
  decide what source materials are worth examining in more detail. This concise,
  structured format has also proven useful for publishing all kinds of small,
  time-sensitive nuggets of information, including <a href="http://www.flickr.com/" target="_blank">Flickr's</a> photo
  journals, <a href="http://www.craigslist.org/" target="_blank">Craigslist classifieds</a>,
  and <a href="http://crcp-blogger.mit.edu/geoblogger/" target="_blank">local
  events.</a> </p>
<p><a href="http://www.georss.org" target="_blank">GeoRSS</a> is simple proposal
  for RSS feeds to also be
described by location or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geotagging" target="_blank">Geotagged</a>.
We standardize the way in which "where" is encoded
with enough <em>simplicity</em> and <em>descriptive power</em> to
satisfy most needs to describe the location of Web content. 
GeoRSS may not work for every use (for example, we provide for only one location
per RSS entry), but it should serve as an easy-to-use geotagging language that
is brief and simple with useful defaults but extensible and
upwardly-compatible with more sophisticated formats like the <a href="http://www.opengeospatial.org/">OGC
(Open Geospatial Consortium)</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geography_Markup_Language">GML</a> (Geography
Markup Language).</p>
<p>GeoRSS also serves informally as an extension to the W3C <a href="http://www.w3.org/2003/01/geo/" target="_blank">geo
    (point)</a> vocabulary
(sometimes also referred to as "GeoRSS"), adding important additional kinds of
location
(points, lines, and boundaries) as well as other extensibility.</p>
<p>As an example of the need for more than just a point, consider a blog about a kayaking trip. Each RSS entry from such a blog could perhaps be described
by a point location, but the entire voyage is clearly a linear path. The line description is
especially important for making maps of trips with trip lengths, intersections, and so on.
Boundaries are important when you need to specify the edges of an area, which is very
useful in talking about things within a certain state, town, or
neighborhood for example.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most powerful advantages of GeoRSS feeds will be seen
in the possibilities for geographic search and aggregation. More than just
  getting feeds for a particular city or zip code, using GeoRSS it will be posssible
  to search with all sorts of geographic criteria. Perhaps all earthquake-related
  items within 20 miles of your home--delivered to your phone, or a feed of traffic
  accident items along your daily commute? Once RSS feeds contain geographic
location, applications like these and more will be possible. </p>

<h2>GeoRSS model</h2>
<a name="model"></a>
<p><img src="graphics/georss-model.png" width="587" height="346" />
<strong>
<p align="center">Figure 1. - GeoRSS Model</p>
</strong>

<p>Figure 1 shows the UML model for GeoRSS. The left side of Figure 1 represents
  GeoRSS, the right side represents the &quot;external&quot; content that GeoRSS is being
used to describe. In the model, <strong>where</strong> is an association <em>of</em> a <strong>geometry</strong> to
some
  <strong>content</strong>. GeoRSS places no constraint on the type of content,
  nor on its format.
<p>GeoRSS itself is identified by a namespace, indicated by &quot;georss:&quot;.
  The model above does not show, but allows, the inclusion of any other elements
  from other
  namespaces.
<p>The model itself is an abstract concept. In order to use the model, it must
  be expressed in a concrete form such as XML, RDF, etc. These expressions are
  called <strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serialization">serializations</a></strong>.
<p>By allowing for the definition of multiple serializations, all of which conform
  to the model, GeoRSS will provide the means of relating one serialization to
  another. The goal is to also map the model to existing serializations where
  possible.
<p>The core concepts of GeoRSS are explained below. These concepts
    are then encoded or serialized in
    XML for use with <a href="#atom">Atom or RSS 2.0</a>. Alternate serializations
    such as in RDF and XHTML are
    also being developed.
<h3>Coordinate reference system (CRS)</h3>
<p>There aren't real grid lines or axes on the earth, so any GeoRSS coordinates
  must refer to a <a href="https://portal.opengeospatial.org/files/?artifact_id=6716">coordinate
  reference system</a> which has been defined and agreed to by geodesists and
  software makers alike. The GeoRSS  CRS is the global (and GPS-preferred) <strong>WGS84,
  latitude, longitude</strong> (in that order), using <strong>decimal degrees</strong>.
   Note that GeoRSS
  lines and boundaries are allowed to do things like cross the dateline or circle
  the poles.</p>
<h3>Geometry</h3>
<p>The geometric shapes which can be used to represent location in GeoRSS
  are <strong>point</strong>, <strong>line</strong>,
  and <strong>boundary</strong>. </p>
<p>A <strong>point</strong> contains a single coordinate pair. The coordinate pair contains a
  latitude value and a longitude value<em> in that order</em>. The <em>preferred</em> serialization
  of this uses a <em>space</em> to separate the two values.</p>
<p>A <strong>line</strong> contains two or more coordinate pairs. Each pair contains
  a latitude value and a longitude value<em> in that order</em>. The <em>preferred</em> serialization
of this uses a <em>space</em> to separate the two values.  Pairs are  separated
from each other
by a <em>space</em>.</p>
<p>A <strong>box</strong> contains exactly two coordinate pairs. Each
  pair contains a latitude value and a longitude value<em> in that order</em>.
  The <em>preferred</em> serialization of this uses a <em>space</em> to separate
  the two values. Pairs are separated from each other
by a <em>space</em>. The first coordinate pair (lower corner) must be a point
further
west and south of the second coordinate pair (upper corner) and the box is always
interpreted
as
not
containing the 180 (or -180) degree longitude line other than on its boundary
and
not
containing
the
North
or South pole other than on its boundary. A box <em>is generally</em> used to <em>roughly</em>demarcate
an area within which other data lie.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="graphics/gml_envelope.jpg" width="260" height="140" /></p>
<p>A <strong>polygon</strong> contains at least four coordinate pairs. Each
  pair contains a latitude value and a longitude value<em> in that order</em>.
  The <em>preferred</em> serialization
    of this uses a <em>space</em> to separate the two values. Pairs are separated
    from each other
  by a <em>space</em>. The last coordinate pair must be identical to the first.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="graphics/179-rule.jpg" width="446" height="248" /></p>
<p align="center"><strong>Figure 2. - 179 degree rule</strong></p>
<p>Due to the fact that the Earth is round, we have to place some constraints
  on the geometries to avoid ambiguous shapes. In order to be able to easily
   represent the red box in Figure 2, where the left side of the box is at 160
  degrees longitude and the right side of the box is at -175 degrees,<strong> no
  two points in a line or polygon may have latitude values that are more than
  179
  degrees
  apart</strong>. This constraint avoids other approaches that require either
  additional information about the topology of the geometry or preclude the ability
  to represen
  geometries such as this. Since topology is beyond
  the scope of this specification, it should not matter that you may have to
  add
  an extra point into your geometries. <strong>Line</strong> and <strong>polygon</strong> <strong>MUST</strong>  follow
  this rule. <strong>Box</strong> does not.</p>
<h3>Feature Type Tag</h3>
<p>GeoRSS geometry is meant to represent a real feature of the Earth's surface.
  The GeoRSS model allows for a single <em>string</em> containing a <strong>featuretypetag</strong>.
  No constraints are placed on this string. The intent is to allow a Feature
  Type <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folksonomy">folksonomy</a>  to
  emerge. The default is &quot;<strong>location&quot;</strong>.  </p>
<h3>Relationship Tag</h3>
<p>GeoRSS is a way of <em>relating</em> Web <strong>content</strong> to Earth <strong>features</strong>.
  The GeoRSS model allows for a single string containing a <strong>relationshiptag</strong>.
  No constraints are placed on this string. The intent is to allow a relationship <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folksonomy">folksonomy</a> to
  emerge.The default
  relationship, &quot;<strong>is-located-at</strong>&quot; simply indicates that
  the subject of the content<strong>  </strong>is located
  at<strong> </strong> the
  GeoRSS feature. </p>
<h3>Elevation</h3>
<p>In order to provide a means of expressing an elevation, the Simple form of
  GeoRSS has two special tags. These tags are not meant to be used in the
  GML version since elevation values would be properly expressed based in more
  precise
  terms. The tags are <strong>elev</strong> and <strong>floor</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>elev</strong> is meant to contain &quot;common&quot; GPS elevation readings,
  i.e. height in meters from the WGS84 ellipsoid, which is a reading that should
  be easy to get from any GPS device.</p>
<p><strong>floor</strong> is meant to contain the floor number of a building. In some countries
  the numbering is different than in other countries, but since we'll know the
  location of the building, it should be fairly unambiguous.</p>

<h2>GeoRSS GML</h2>
<p><font size="-1"><em>Geography Markup Language (GML) is an XML grammar written in XML Schema for the modelling, transport, and storage of geographic information...GML provides a variety of kinds of objects for describing geography including features, coordinate reference systems, geometry, topology, time, units of measure and generalized values. A geographic feature is "an abstraction of a real world phenomenon; it is a geographic feature if it is associated with a location relative to the Earth�. So a digital representation of the real world can be thought of as a set of features.<br>

<h3><a name="gmlcrs"></a>Coordinate Reference System Usage</h3>
<p>Coming soon.  </p>
<h2><a name="gmlappschema"></a>GML profile and application schema for GeoRSS</h2>
<p>All good information encodings should be backed by a formal definition. In this case, we use XML schema to do the job. This helps software developers--especially XML-savvy ones, know the full capabilities of the language, and program their software to handle any case, not just those they've come across in examples.</p>
<h3>GML Profile</h3>
<p>GML is a large and complex language which is also defined by XML schema. Since it is so large, a practice has emerged to define subsets of GML, called Profiles, that contain only those elements of GML needed for the encoding job at hand. </p>
<p>Here is our <a href="xml/1.0/gmlgeorss.xsd" target="_blank">GeoRSS GML Profile [http://www.georss.org/xml/1.0/gmlgeorss.xsd]</a>.</p>
<p>We also have a rather large graphic of the <a href="graphics/georss-gml-uml.png" target="_blank">UML model for this profile</a>.  </p>
<h3>GeoRSS Application Schema</h3>
<p>The application schema defines  &lt;georss:where&gt; as the tag that signals geographic content--either in GeoRSS Simple or GML. </p>
<p>Here is our GeoRSS Application Schema <a href="xml/1.0/georss.xsd" target="_blank"> [http://www.georss.org/xml/1.0/georss.xsd]</a>.</p>
<p>The UML model is shown below. Click on it for a larger, more readable version. </p>

<h2>Simple GeoRSS</h2>
<p>The Simple serialization of GeoRSS is designed to be maximally concise, in both representation and conception. Each of the four GeoRSS objects require only a single tag.</p>

<p>This simplicity comes at the cost of direct upward compatibility with GML. However, it is straightforward to devise transformations from this Simple serialization to the GML serialization through the GML model. For many needs, GeoRSS Simple will be sufficient.</p>

<p>Some publishers and users may prefer to separate lat/long pairs by a comma rather than whitespace. This is permissible in Simple; GeoRSS parsers should just treat commas as whitespace.</p> 

<p>The first example shows GeoRSS Simple within an Atom 1.0 entry. This serialization applies just as well to an RSS 2.0 or RSS 1.0 item; it can also be associated with the entire feed. The rest of the examples show only the encoding of the objects and attributes.<p/>

<h2>Geometry</h2>

<h3> Point</h3>
<p> A point contains a single latitude-longitude pair, separated by whitespace. </p>

<h3> Line</h3>
<p>A line contains a space separated list of latitude-longitude pairs, with each pair separated by whitespace. There must be at least two pairs.</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>&lt;georss:line&gt;45.256 -110.45 46.46 -109.48 43.84 -109.86&lt;/georss:line&gt;
</pre>
</blockquote>

<h3>Polygon</h3>
<p>A polygon contains a space separated list of latitude-longitude pairs, with
  each pair separated by whitespace. There must be at least four pairs, with
  the last
  being identical to the first (so a polygon has a minimum of three actual points).</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>&lt;georss:polygon&gt;
	45.256 -110.45 46.46 -109.48 43.84 -109.86 45.256 -110.45
&lt;/georss:polygon&gt;

</pre>
</blockquote>

<h3>Box</h3>
<p>A bounding box is a rectangular region, often used to define the extents of a map or a rough area of interest. A box contains two space separate latitude-longitude pairs, with each pair separated by whitespace. The first pair is the lower corner, the second is the upper corner.</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>&lt;georss:box&gt;42.943 -71.032 43.039 -69.856&lt;/georss:box&gt;
</pre>
</blockquote>

<h2>Attributes</h2>
<h3>Feature Type and Relationship Tags</h3>
<p>The Feature Type and Relationship tags are specified as attributes to GeoRSS Geometry objects.</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
    &lt;georss:point <b>featuretypetag="city" relationshiptag="is-centered-at"</b>&gt;
     45.256 -110.45
    &lt;/georss:point&gt;
</pre>
</blockquote>

<h3>Elevation</h3>

<p>Elevation, specified in attributes to GeoRSS Geometry objects, can be expressed as "elev" or "floor". elev is meant to contain "common" GPS elevation readings, i.e. height in meters from the WGS84 ellipsoid, which is a reading that should be easy to get from any GPS device. floor is meant to contain the floor number of a building. In some countries the numbering is different than in other countries, but since we'll know the location of the building, it should be fairly unambiguous.<p/>

<blockquote>
<pre>
    &lt;georss:point <b>elev="313"</b>&gt;45.256 -110.45&lt;/georss:point&gt;

    &lt;georss:point <b>floor="2"</b>&gt;45.256 -110.45&lt;/georss:point&gt;
</pre>
</blockquote>

<h3>Radius</h3>
<p>"radius" indicates the size in meters of a radius or buffer around the geometry object, for example, radius of circular area around a point geometry.<p/>
<blockquote>
<pre>
    &lt;georss:point <b>radius="500"</b>&gt;45.256 -110.45&lt;/georss:point&gt;

<h2>W3C Basic Geo Vocabulary</h2>
<p>
The W3C <a href="http://www.w3.org/2003/01/geo/">Basic Geo Vocabulary</a> is a RDF vocabulary for representing the latitude and longitude of spatially-located things. It is widely used within RDF documents, as well as a namespace within non-RDF XML documents, such as RSS 2.0 and Atom. There are myriad publishers, applications and services using the format. Its rapid uptake has been a significant motivation in devising the "georss" namespace.
</p>
<p>
You are encouraged to utilize the GeoRSS Content Model and Encodings. However, W3C Geo has great inertia and will continue to be an important format. It is recommended that GeoRSS Parsers support W3C Geo. In time, the hope is that these two namespaces can be reconciled.
</p>
<p>
The vocabulary defines a class 'Point', whose members are points. Points can be described using the 'lat' and 'long' properties.
</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
&lt;geo:Point>
  &lt;geo:lat>55.701&lt;/geo:lat>
  &lt;geo:long>12.552&lt;/geo:long>
&lt;/geo:Point>
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
In common usage, the containing Point is dropped, for brevity.

<h2>GeoRSS in Atom</h2>
<h3> Overview</h3>
<p>Location is specified using Atom 1.0's official extension mechanism (see <a href="http://www.atompub.org/2005/08/17/draft-ietf-atompub-format-11.html#extending_atom" target="_blank">Extending Atom</a>). We add a <strong>&lt;georss:where&gt;</strong> element as a child of the <strong>&lt;entry&gt;</strong> element. Within <strong>&lt;georss:where&gt;</strong> you may specify geography. We recommend that the <a href="#gml">GML encoding</a> is used as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <!--
   <li>      position <strong>&lt;georss:pos&gt; </strong> </li> -->
  <li> point <strong>&lt;gml:Point&gt; </strong> </li>
  <li> line <strong>&lt;gml:LineString&gt;</strong></li>
  <li>polygon<strong> &lt;gml:Polygon&gt;</strong></li>
  <li> box<strong> &lt;gml:Envelope&gt; </strong></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="#simple">GeoRSS Simple </a> could also be used:</p>
<ul>
  <!--
   <li>      position <strong>&lt;georss:pos&gt; </strong> </li> -->
  <li> point <strong>&lt;georss:point&gt; </strong> </li>
  <li> line <strong>&lt;georss:line&gt;</strong></li>
  <li>polygon<strong> &lt;georss:polygon&gt;</strong></li>
  <li> box<strong> &lt;georss:box&gt; </strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Atom processing software is required to either read or ignore this type of "foreign markup"--not fail, so there is no danger of breaking someone's RSS reader (or publisher) by including this &lt;where&gt; element in your feed. </p>
<p>NOTE: GML allows you to specify a coordinate reference system (CRS) other than WGS84 decimal degrees (think lat/long). If you have a need to express geography in a CRS other than this, we recommend that you specify the geographic object multiple times, one in  WGS84 and the others in your other desired CRSes. </p>
<h3>Examples</h3>
<p>for now see the <a href="#gmlexamples">examples on the GML page</a> </p>

<h2>GeoRSS in RDF</h2>
<h3>RDF: a quick introduction</h3>

<p><i>This material is preliminary and only for discussion at this time. </i></p>

</p>

<p>
The RDF data model is so simple that it can be explained in a few paragraphs.</p>

RDF encodes information using statements of the form 
"the object O has property P with value V".  The value of a property may be a literal value,
such as a string or number, or another object. Properties and objects are usually named using URIs.
Here is an example:</p>


<p>
<pre style="z-index: 3;">
    the Object http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astoria_Oregon has 
    the Property http://www.georss.org/georss/point with value
    "46.183 -123.816".
</pre>
</p>

<p>This statement means that the geographical location associated 
with the specified Wikipedia page has latitude 46.183 and longitude
-123.816.  In this case, the object is a web page, but physical or conceptual
entities can also be named by URI in RDF statements.</p>

<p>
A unit of RDF content (eg an RDF page) is nothing more than a set of such statements.
If the objects and literals are construed as nodes, and the statements as edges,
the RDF data model can be viewed as a labeled directed graph. In particular, the statement
"A has property P with value B" is represented by an edge labeled P joining node 
A to node B.
The detailed rules concerning labeling are: an edge is always labeled with a URI;
an object node may be unlabeled, or labeled with a URI; a literal node is labeled
with its value.
</p>


<p>
This simple data model has several serializations - several representations as linear
text.  The most commonly used (and the most complicated) utilizes XML. In XML, 
nodes and properties are represented by XML elements. The properties of a node element are its
children; each property element has a child, or content in the case of a literal,
representing the value of the property. For example:
</p>

<pre style="z-index: 3;">
&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt;
&lt;rdf:RDF 
      xmlns:rdf="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#
      xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/"
      xmlns:georss="http://www.georss.org/georss/"&gt;

   &lt;rdf:Description rdf:about="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astoria_Oregon"&gt;
       &lt;dc:title&gt;Astoria, Oregon&lt;/dc:title&gt;
       <strong>&lt;georss:point&gt;46.183 -123.816&lt;/georss:point&gt;</strong>
   &lt;/rdf:Description&gt;

&lt;/rdf:RDF&gt;
</pre>

</p>

<p>For more information about RDF, see the <a href="http://www.w3.org/RDF">RDF</a> pages at W3C.</p>

<h3>Simple GeoRSS in RDF and RSS 1.0</h3>

<p>
In the RDF framework, the content and meaning of <a href="#simple">Simple
GeoRSS</a> can be 
stated in a few words:
<strong>georss:point, georss:line, georss:polygon, and georss:box</strong>
are RDF properties. Each has a string literal as value, with the detailed
forms as explained on the  <a href="#simple">Simple GeoRSS</a> page.
Asserting that the value of the property <strong>georss:point</strong>  for an
object <strong>A</strong>
 is <strong>"lat,long"</strong>
means that the geographical location with these coordinates is  associated with <strong>A</strong>.
 The nature of the association is left unspecified. 
Similarly, the properties <strong>georss:line, georss:polygon,</strong> and<strong> georss:box</strong>,
 assert the existence of associated 
earth-located geometries.</p>

<p>
These properties can be used in any RDF context to make simple geographical assertions
  about objects. Of particular interest in the current context is the RDF dialect
  of RSS: 
<a href="http://web.resource.org/rss/1.0/">RSS 1.0</a>. However, there is nothing
special about how GeoRSS properties are used in RSS 1.0 - we need only note that
any of the RSS 1.0 elements can be annotated with GeoRSS properties, including
rss:channel, rss:item, and rss:image. Here is an example:</p>
